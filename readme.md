# Thought Bot

Thought Bot is an interactive Python bot that provides various perspectives and insights on a given question by simulating different ways of thinking. It combines responses inspired by Newton's laws, Leonardo da Vinci, human intuition, neural networks, quantum computing, and resilient kindness.

## Features

- **Newton's Thoughts**: Applies a metaphorical version of Newton's laws to the question.
- **Da Vinci's Insights**: Provides creative and cosmic perspectives inspired by Leonardo da Vinci.
- **Human Intuition**: Offers intuitive responses focusing on emotional and instinctual reactions.
- **Neural Network Thinking**: Suggests AI-inspired perspectives using neural networks and machine learning.
- **Quantum Computing Thinking**: Applies principles of quantum computing to the question.
- **Resilient Kindness**: Provides perspectives focused on resilience and kindness.
- **Universal Reasoning**: Combines responses from all the above perspectives.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd my_bot_project
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Create a `data.json` file**:
    Create a file named `data.json` in the project directory and add the following JSON data:

    ```json
